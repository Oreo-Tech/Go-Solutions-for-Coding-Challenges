# Go-Solutions-for-Coding-Challenges

Description: https://medium.com/go-lang-solution-for-coding-challenges
For various coding challenges &amp; problem solving questions, here you'll find their solutions written in Go lang

I got introduced to Go lang in 2017 and since then I have loved the this language, I really enjoy the fact that how really systematic, lightweight and  easy this language gets once you get involved in it.


But when I started to learn Data structures, Algorithm and got into solving coding challenges, I found out there are very less number of rescources to pratice in golang, infact some sites don't even support writing in golang

So that's when I thought to create a repo to include the solutions to coding  problems which are solved using golang

here you'll see examples where we implment list, binary tree, queue, stack, and other programming techniques using the features of golang like struct, map, list and many.


I try to post the explanation for this solution at below mentioned blogs site, you can read through it for futher explanation
